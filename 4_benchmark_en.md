The DivDis paper presents a simple algorithm to solve these ambiguity problems. DivDis uses multi-head neural networks, and a loss that encourages the heads to use independent information. Once training is complete, the best head can be selected by testing all different heads on the validation data.

DivDis achieves 70% accuracy on the unlabeled set of *human_age* and 97% accuracy on the unlabeled set of *human_hair*.
