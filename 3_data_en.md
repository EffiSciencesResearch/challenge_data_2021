# The main dataset: Human_Age

We have 4 types of images: Age Young Text Old (AYTO), Age Young Text Young (AYTY), etc. We give:
- a labeled set : 20000 images (either Age old with “old” or young with written “young”)
- an unlabeled set : circa 70000 images (50% mix rate, all 4 types of images present in equal proportion). 

Human_Age weighs 630 Mo.


# The toy datasets : human_hair and the MNIST_embeding_datasets

We offer to distribute a complementary dataset, human_hair, with all the labels public to allow participants to iterate more easily before tackling human_age which is more complicated.
DivDis obtains 97% of accuracy on the unlabeled set of human_hair.
Human_Hair weighs 14 Mo.
